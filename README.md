This project includes our Stock Brokerage website and web application, and Stock Exchange web application. Npm and NodeJS are both required to run the applications.

The Stock Exchange application is located in the "StockExchange" folder. You must first install the dependencies for the application. To do this, open a terminal window inside the "StockExchange" folder and run 'npm i' or 'npm install'. Once the dependencies have been installed run the application by executing the command 'npm start' or 'node index.js'. The exchange is available on localhost port 8081 (http://localhost:8081)

The Stock Brokerage website and web app are located in the "stock" folder. You must first install the dependencies for the application. To do this, open a terminal window inside the "stock" folder and run 'npm i' or 'npm install'. Once the dependencies have been installed run the application by executing the command 'node server.js'. Access the website in the browser at https://localhost:8081
